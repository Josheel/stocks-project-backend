Overview
The Stocks Project Backend is a RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript, designed to manage and serve stock-related data. It provides endpoints for retrieving stock information, managing user data, and integrating with external stock data sources.

Features
Stock Data Retrieval: Fetch real-time and historical stock data.

User Management: Endpoints for user registration and authentication.

Data Integration: Interfaces with external APIs for up-to-date stock information.

Tech Stack
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.

Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.

TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for type safety.

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests.

dotenv: Module to load environment variables from a .env file.
